How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `rcpud`/`rcpud-qt` (on Linux).

Compatibility
=============

RCPU is built as a new chain type on top of the Bitcoin Core software. RCPU
can connect to the Bitcoin network and operate as a Bitcoin client fully compatible
with the current network consensus rules. However, it is not recommended to use RCPU
as a Bitcoin client, and instead Bitcoin Core should be used.

Changes
=======

- Fixed a crash which could happen randomly when syncing after launch
- RandomX fast mode now activates after initial block download completes
- Updated copyright in source files
- Checkpoint added
